\title{Wrapper for split_baits() that interacts with the filesystem}
\usage{
split_baits_fs(bins_dir, residuals_dir, indices, output_dir, plots = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{bins_dir}{Directory containing putative interactions that are binned by distance.}

\item{residuals_dir}{Directory where the adjusted read counts from each distance bin are stored.}

\item{indices}{Indices of distance bins whose baits are processed. These must all have had null models fitted.}

\item{output_dir}{Directory where all putative interactive will be stored, one file per bait. Will be created if it does not exist.}

\item{plots}{Whether adjusted readcounts are to be plotted aganst distance and stored for each bait.}
}
\value{
The output directory.
}
\description{
Calculates p-values under the negative binomial model. Subsequently regroups putative interactions by bait, rather than by distance, to prepare them for parallel RJMCMC processing. Generates a separate file for each bait. Paths are stored in baitlist.txt, which serves as a to-do list for peaky().
