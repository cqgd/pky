\title{Wrapper for interpret_peaky() that interacts with the filesystem}
\usage{
interpret_peaky_fs(rjmcmclist, index, baits_dir, output_dir, omega_power)
}
\arguments{
\item{rjmcmclist}{Path to the list of RJMCMC results to be interpreted.}

\item{index}{Which RJMCMC result on the list to process, with 1 corresponding to the first one on the list.}

\item{output_dir}{Directory where the merged RJMCMC results and bait information will be stored, one file per bait. Will be created if it does not exist.}

\item{omega_power}{The same value as used when running peaky, i.e. the expected decay of adjusted read counts around a truly interacting prey. See details.}
}
\value{
The output directory.
}
\description{
Extracts the marginal posterior probabilities of contact and other relevant statistics from the RJMCMC results and merges these with bait-associated information.
}
\section{Details}{

The steepness of the function to be fitted to putative peaks is determined by \eqn{\omega} according to \eqn{\beta \exp{- \abs{\omega * d}}}, where \eqn{\beta} represents peak height and \eqn{d} the distance from the center of the peak in bp.
