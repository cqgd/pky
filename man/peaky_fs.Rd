\usage{
peaky_fs(
  baitlist,
  index,
  output_dir,
  omega_power,
  iterations = 1e+06,
  min_interactions = 20
)
}
\arguments{
\item{baitlist}{Path to the list of baits to be processed.}

\item{index}{Which bait on the list to process, with 1 corresponding to the first one on the list.}

\item{output_dir}{Directory where all RJMCMC results will be stored. Will be created if it does not exist.}

\item{omega_power}{Expected decay of adjusted read counts around a truly interacting prey. See details.}

\item{iterations}{Number of models to parametrize. Greated numbers should lead to increased reproducibility.}

\item{min_interactions}{Minimum requirement for the number of prey fragments (and thus counts) associated with a bait, baits with fewer are skipped.}
}
\value{
List containing the model output directory and the models themselves.
}
\description{
Fits additive models of peaks of varying strengths in various locations to the adjusted readcounts via RJMCMC, and stores these models on disk.
}
\section{Details}{

The steepness of the function to be fitted to putative peaks is determined by \eqn{\omega} according to \eqn{\beta} exp(-\eqn{|\omega * d|}), where \eqn{\beta} represents peak height and \eqn{d} the distance from the center of the peak in bp.
